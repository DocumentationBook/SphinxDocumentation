There are two software products branded as Sphinx. This book is about the well-known documentation tool,
also called Sphinx-doc to distinguish it.

`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ is a powerful documentation tool (framework) used to create
a set of bound documents (documentation tree) in different formats (HTML, PDF, ePub, and many more) taking source
documents marked with reStructuredText (reST) or Markdown.
Sphinx is shipped as a Python package along with many other packages. Among the latter,
`Docutils <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/>`_ is the main reST interpreter.
That is why Docutils is often mentioned in this documentation.

The examples are oriented on Unix and Linux notation regarding the file system. In a Windows
environment, please make the proper changes.
