There are two software products branded as Sphinx. This book is about the well-known documentation tool
also called Sphinx-doc to distinguish it.


Introduction
============

`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ is a powerful documentation tool (framework) used to create
a set of bound documents (documentation tree) in different formats (HTML, PDF, ePub, and many more) taking source
documents marked with reStructuredText (reST) or Markdown.
Sphinx is shipped as a Python package along with many other packages. Among the latter,
`Docutils <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/>`_ is the main reST interpreter.
That is why Docutils is often mentioned in this documentation.

The examples are oriented on Unix and Linux notation regarding the file system. In a Windows
environment, please make the proper changes.


Additional resources
====================

This book doesn't cover all aspects about reST, Docutils, and Sphinx. That is why you are welcome to get more information on
the subject from various internet resources, for example:

*  `reStructuredText Markup Specification <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_
*  `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_
*  `Using the technical documentation generator <https://chiplicity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Using_Sphinx/index.html>`_
