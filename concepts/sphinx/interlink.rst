Hardcoded links
===============


Intersphinx
===========

A Sphinx project has an inventory file named ``objects.inv`` as a cache containing all internal links generated by Sphinx.
By default it is stored at the root of the build documentation set, for example, at ``_build/dirhtml/objects.inv``.
Therefore, if you have access to another documentation set built by Sphinx, you can download and read this file.
To see the full list of intersphinx links in your own project and in the official Python documentation,
run the following commands::

   $  python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx _build/dirhtml/objects.inv

   $ python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx https://docs.python.org/3/objects.inv

You can save the inventory file under any name and *optionally* add a link to it in the ``conf.py`` file,
for example::

   extensions.append('sphinx.ext.intersphinx')
   intersphinx_mapping = {'python': ('https://docs.python.org/3', 'python-inv.txt')}

Instead of specifying the local inventory file, you can use ``None``, which means that Sphinx will download the
remote file and save it in its cache.
