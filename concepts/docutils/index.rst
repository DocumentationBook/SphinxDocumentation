Docutils is the main interpreter of reST files. It works with separate files converting each of them to a separate HTML
target.

Documentation processing (parsing and transformation) is based on an intermediate representation of a source as
a documentation tree in the XML format similar to the `DocBook <https://tdg.docbook.org/>`_ schema.
Docutils has its own formal `DTD <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/docutils.dtd>`_ (document type definition).
